# Project description

The Quantum Innovation Challenge (quantum-challenge.eu) is a collaborative effort between many Danish and international parties (Novo Foundation, Bio Innovation Institute, MQS, Danish Business Authority and many more) to develop an open-source library of applied quantum computing packages for the pharma and life science industries.

The currently on-going challenge is described on the challenge and involves PK/PD modelling and how quantum computing can be applied to improve pre-clinical research.

The top 5 team are currently working further on their Phase 2 submissions (see landing page of the homepage) and all Phase 1 submissions can be found here (5 projects were selected for Phase 2): https://github.com/Quantum-Innovation-Challenge/LSQI-Challenge-2025/tree/main/projects

### Goal

Analyze the project folders and see which specific project idea you can utilize to start your own hackathon project. The Quantum Innovation Challenge will very likely be held again in 2026 and thus you are already preparing for this challenge.
