# Project description

The Xenakis quantum circuit designer is based on a set of pre-defined gates and sub-circuits which a genetic algorithm can select from to build quantum circuits to evaluate via VQE which circuit design performs best.

MQS has won the Creative Destruction Lab Hackathon 2022 (https://github.com/CDL-Quantum) competition and also received the Xanadu prize for the development of Xenakis.
The work on this topic has carried on via a collaboration between MQS and Evert van Nieuwenburg, where a Msc thesis project has continued with the research.

At MQS we have not yet found the time and capacity to work these developments back into the Xenakis repo.

### Goal

Implement the NEAT method and/or other valuable methods and make a pull request to the Xenakis repository. Analyze which concepts could be improved or further extended (literature research with newest developments).
